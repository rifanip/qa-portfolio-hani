Feature: Customer Page

  As a QA Engineer
  I want to test the customer creation and update flow
  So that the system behaves correctly for valid and invalid inputs

  Background:
    Given the user is logged in
    And the user navigates to the Customer Page

  Scenario: Add new customer with valid details
    When the user clicks on "Add Customer"
    And the user enters "John" in the First Name field
    And the user enters "Doe" in the Last Name field
    And the user enters "john.doe@example.com" in the Email field
    And the user clicks "Save"
    Then the system should show message "Customer added successfully"
    And the customer "John Doe" should be listed in the customer table

  Scenario: Add customer with missing fields
    When the user clicks on "Add Customer"
    And the user leaves all fields blank
    And the user clicks "Save"
    Then the system should display validation errors:
      | Field      | Message                  |
      | First Name | "First Name is required" |
      | Email      | "Email is required"      |

  Scenario: Update existing customer
    Given a customer "John Doe" exists
    When the user clicks "Edit" for "John Doe"
    And the user updates the Last Name to "Smith"
    And the user clicks "Save"
    Then the system should show message "Customer updated successfully"
    And the customer name should be updated to "John Smith"
